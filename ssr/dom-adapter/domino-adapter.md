The file `domino-adapter.ts` is an exact copy of the same file in the angualr repo (`angular/packages/platform-server/src/domino_adapter.ts`)

The reason for the copy is that it is not possible to get a reference to the source class `DominoAdapter`.

See https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/d95e0594805c06867d41885fadd3f07e593c5884/packages/platform-server/src/domino_adapter.ts
